Widgets do not work properly when moved to external storage. This is because widgets have to run constantly, but the SD card can be unmounted at any time, for example, when used in USB mass storage mode.

For more information, see [Android developer information on apps that should not be moved to external storage](http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/install-location.html#ShouldNot).
